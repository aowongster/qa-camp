# QA Train

A collection of QA resources to jump into the world of QA.

There's a growing demand for software engineers and QA people alike. While there's been a surge of interest in software development, the demand for QA hasn't been fulfilled nor match the increase of available software developers. That means, there's a bunch of coders, but not enough testers to support them.

The goal of this project is to provide a collection of tools and resources to prepare oneself for a career in Quality Assurance.

QA is an often overlooked and underrated field. I have a dream.. of a world where QA and Dev work side by side, hand in hand.
